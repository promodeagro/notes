I have worked primarily with machine learning, NLP, predictive analytics, and AI model deployment.

I have used AI tools in AWS clouds like AWS SageMaker, EC2, Lambda, EKS.....

I have extensively used 

I have deployed machine learning (ML) model for ML-Ops for use in production environment, the models were deployed for sentiment analysis of ecommerce customers , also for the forecasting model for demand notes generations. I have used Python and used python libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch for creating ML models and managing their life-cycles. I have also used NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib to create the ML models for business use cases 

I have also done Model Serialization using TensorFlow SavedModel,Pickle.

I have also worked on ML model deployment as part of microservices using RESTful APIs or gRPC
I have used tools like Docker to package models and dependencies into portable containers.I have also used Kubernetes to manage and scale model deployments.

I have also worked on ML model optimization , applied techniques to ensure the deployed model meets Latency and Throughput , performance requirements. I have also worked on ML model Quantization and Pruning, reducing model size for faster inference, especially important for edge or mobile deployments.I also deployed AI models to edge devices or IoT systems using TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch Mobile.

AWS SageMaker, EC2, Lambda, EKS

Scikit-learn- Ideal for data analysis, exploration, and traditional ML tasks where neural networks are not necessary

TensorFlow - Suited for production-level deep learning applications and neural network-based solutions 

PyTorch - Preferred for research, experimentation, and development of deep learning models

How LLM works:

LLM Data Generation Workflow (Top Row)

Input Text (Prompt): The user provides a prompt or query to the LLM.

Tokenization: The text is split into smaller units (tokens) that the model processes.

Embedding Layer: Tokens are converted into numerical representations (vectors) that the model understands.

Transformer Layers: These layers process the embeddings using self-attention mechanisms to generate context-aware representations.

Output Tokens: The model predicts the next token sequentially until the output is complete.
Generated Text: The tokens are combined to produce the final human-readable text.

Vector Database Workflow (Bottom Row)
Query: A query (e.g., text, image, or document) is submitted for searching in the vector database.

Vector Embedding: The query is converted into a vector representation using the same or similar embedding process as the LLM.

Vector Database: The database stores pre-computed embeddings of data. The query vector is compared with these embeddings to find the most similar ones.

Relevant Results: The system retrieves and returns the most relevant matches based on vector similarity.

Popular Tools for Implementing RAG
OpenAI GPT: Paired with a vector database like Pinecone or Weaviate for retrieval.
Hugging Face Transformers: Provides tools for both retrieval and generation.
LangChain: A popular library for building RAG workflows.
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): An open-source library for efficient similarity search in large datasets.

Applications of RAG
Question Answering:
Providing factual answers using external knowledge bases.
Example: Customer support systems that pull answers from a product manual.
Document Summarization:
Summarizing large sets of documents by retrieving relevant sections.
Personalized Recommendations:
Generating personalized outputs by retrieving user-specific data (e.g., past interactions).
Legal and Medical Domains:
Assisting professionals by retrieving relevant case studies or medical records.
Search Engine Enhancement:
Generating richer, more informative search results.
