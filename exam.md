i Task1:

Issue:
The math expression IF(desiredCapacity > inServiceInstances, 1, 0) is used to trigger the alarm when desiredCapacity exceeds inServiceInstances. However, there are a few concerns:

Trigger Sensitivity: The alarm is configured to trigger if this condition is met for just 1 out of 1 data point. This could lead to false positives, as a temporary fluctuation in metrics (e.g., a single transient spike) would trigger the alarm.

Evaluation Period: The Period is set to 5 minutes, which may be too short for stable evaluation, depending on your application's autoscaling behavior.

Condition Logic: The logic may not account for scenarios where the difference between desiredCapacity and inServiceInstances is temporary or expected (e.g., during scale-up events).

Fix:
Increase Data Points: Adjust the datapoints to alarm to require more than 1 data point within a specified evaluation period. For example:

Use 2 out of 3 data points to reduce sensitivity to transient spikes.
Extend Evaluation Period: Increase the evaluation Period from 5 minutes to a larger value (e.g., 10â€“15 minutes) if your scaling events require more time to stabilize.

Threshold Refinement: Consider refining the logic in the math expression. For example, you could set a condition based on a larger difference between desiredCapacity and inServiceInstances to avoid triggering on minor discrepancies:

Example: IF(desiredCapacity - inServiceInstances > 2, 1, 0).
Updated Configuration Example:
Condition: The alarm triggers if desiredCapacity > inServiceInstances persists for 2 out of 3 data points within 15 minutes.
Math Expression: Refine logic to avoid false positives, such as introducing a threshold for acceptable differences.
This will make the alarm more robust and reduce false alarms while still alerting you when there's a legitimate scaling issue.
