# Prompts that i will use
1.  please set your context to Real-Time-Voice-Cloning
2.  Please scan the code and summarize your understanding of the project briefly
3.  can you provide inline comments explaining the purpose of different code sections, making it easier to grasp the overall workflow.
4.  can you analyze the project and give me the output in the following form:
    Technology > Fraud Detection Models:
        Model Name: "Transaction Anomaly Detector"
        Description: "A machine learning model that uses an unsupervised learning approach to identify anomalous transactions based on historical data."
        Algorithm: "Isolation Forest"
        Libraries: "scikit-learn"
        Performance: "AUC = 0.92"
        Code: (Link to relevant code files in GitHub)
    Technology > APIs & Integrations:
        API Name: "Fraud Detection API"
        Description: "Provides real-time fraud scoring for transactions."
        Endpoint: "[invalid URL removed]"
        Authentication: "API Key"
        Challenges & Opportunities:
        Technical Debt: "Some parts of the codebase are poorly documented and may require refactoring."
        Scalability: "The current architecture may not be able to handle the increased transaction volume from AcquirerFin's platform."
